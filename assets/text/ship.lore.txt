You are aboard the Far Heart, a Wayfinder class exploratory vessel.
This ship is registered on Mars (Sol 4) by Starship Captain Kos Brenner.

This Wayfinder is equipped with an array of computer automated scientific
instruments, desgined to be operated by only one pilot with the aid
of the ship computer.

This Wayfinder is equipped with a debris deflector shield suitable
for speeds up to 25c.

This Wayfinder is equipped with a 50 megawatt mining laser, useful for
ablating material off the surface of asteroids.

This Wayfinder has been modified such that it has the extra fuel capacity
needed for extreme deep space exploration, and thus has a reduced
cargo capacity.
