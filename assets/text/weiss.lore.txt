WEISS MINING CORPORATION

The Weiss Mining Corporation was a mildly successful
asteroid mining operation, notable for setting
up new mining operations in uncharted and very distant
regions of space.

Weiss specialized in finding large deposits of very
rare material.

Weiss' last publicly known operation was in the FAIRHAVEN system,
within the asteroid belt within the CADMUS star system.
