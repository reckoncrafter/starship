    FAIRHAVEN: STELLAR NEIGHBORHOOD

Distance from Earth: 60 light years
Time from Earth at 20c: 3 years

Description:
A collection of 9 closely clustered stars including one binary system.

First explored as part of a failed mining survey mission by the WEISS MINING CORPORATION,
Fairhaven was named for the peculiar locality of its member stars, each being
far closer to all the others, than they are to any other star system.
