# Fuel and Exploration

For replenishing fuel, the player should have to collect the two main components
of rocket fuel: Hydrogen and Oxygen.

This might be done by requiring the player to first find water, a source of Hydrogen and Oxygen,
then another fuel, like hydrocarbons, to be used in a hydrolysis reactor to split the water.

The player would have to potentially explore multiple worlds in a system to find the right fuel,
or find water.

The player would have a maximum amount of water or fuel that they could carry at one time,
and would consume energy, requiring the player to replenish energy by sleeping.
